# Unity Tank AI with Behavior Trees

This project showcases a Unity tank controlled by an advanced Behavior Tree AI system. The tank follows a dynamic patrol routine but intelligently switches to a cooldown state when its charge is low. It waits in the designated recharge area until fully powered up before seamlessly resuming its patrol.

## Key Features:

- Behavior Tree AI: Utilizes a sophisticated behavior tree system for intelligent decision-making.
- Dynamic Patrol: Tank autonomously navigates through a predefined route, providing a realistic patrolling behavior.
- Smart Charge Management: Monitors its energy levels and initiates a cooldown state when necessary for efficient resource utilization.
- Recharge Zone: Designated area where the tank docks to replenish its charge before continuing its patrol.
